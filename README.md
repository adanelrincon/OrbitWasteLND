# Orbit Waste

A web page to learn the basic concepts about space waste, whether it is the types, the hazards and possible solutions.

The web is not yet responsive, so it will only be appropriate to access it from a pc or laptop.
This will be changed for future installments but due to lack of time and some errors, I will try to make it responsive for the next installment.


### Prerequisites

Requirements of the software:
- [NodeJs(<=v18.14.0)](https://nodejs.org/en/download)


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

	npm install

In the project directory, you can run:

	npm start


## Versioning

To see the latest version you will have to move to the "develop" branch since the page is still under development.

To move to the branch, you can run:

	git checkout develop
